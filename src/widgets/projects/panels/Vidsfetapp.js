            <p className='text-md text-gray-300 mb-8'>
                vids-fetching-app, (aka fotovision) is an app that fetches YouTube videos with the user's prompted query. This app uses api from YouTube & renders available 50 videos to user, with the video's thumbnail, title, short description and channel name.
            </p>

            <h1 className='text-2xl mb-2' >Purpose</h1>
            <p className='text-md text-gray-300 mb-8'>
                The purpose of building FotoVision is to understand the concepts of fetching data from an api. This app also teaches and practices the state concepts.
            </p>

            <h1 className='text-2xl mb-2' >Overview</h1>
            <p className='text-md text-gray-300 mb-8'>
                This app essentially has 3 sections. Those are the Search Feature, the Previewer Feature & the Search Result Feature. The 2nd feature, Previewer would not render at the first render of the application, neither the Search Results will appear. It is when the user types some keywords and hits enter, the app sends request to the api & gets back some results. The app then renders the Search Results. When the user clicks on any of the search results, the Previewer pops up at the top, with an embedded YouTube video.
            </p>

            <h1 className='text-2xl mb-2' >Features</h1>
            <div className='mb-8 ml-5'>
                <h2 className='text-lg font-semibold' >1. Search Feature</h2>
                <p className='text-md text-gray-300 mb-3 ml-5'>
                    Search Feature renders at the very top of the app. This is basically a search input bar and a submit button with a search icon. Users initially can type their queries here and hit the submit button or enter on keyboard.
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-lg font-semibold' >2. Search Results Feature</h2>
                <p className='text-md text-gray-300 mb-3 ml-5'>
                    After user submits some queries, the app sends a request to YouTube with the userâ€™s queries, and prints the result from YouTube as a list below the search feature. Every item of this list contains the thumbnail, title, short description and the channel name.
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-lg font-semibold' >3. Previewer Feature</h2>
                <p className='text-md text-gray-300 mb-3 ml-5'>
                    After that the user submitted some query and the Search Result got rendered, the user can click on any search result items, and that video pops up below the search feature and above the list as an YouTube embed. Then the user can click on play button & enjoy the video.
